#### Using Twitter Data to Observe Trends in Financial Markets

#### Project Methodology | Notebook Two

There are several popular investors that gain notoriety by sharing a few of their stock picks on Twitter. The goal of this project is to extract popular Tweets to identify ticker symbols for further analysis. The stock data in this project will come from Yahoo finance. The project will follow the OSEMN framework.  

## Important Note
